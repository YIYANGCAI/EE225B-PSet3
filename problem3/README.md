# Problem 3

## Intro
This code mainly test two types of filters on frequency domain: **Gaussian** and **Butterworth**.
The main idea is to calculate the Fourier transormation and use a transformation matrix to multiple it. Finally, we use inverse Fourier transformation to obtain the processed image.

## Usage
> opencv, numpy packages are required for running this code
```
python main.py
```
three outputs correspond to three subquestions.
